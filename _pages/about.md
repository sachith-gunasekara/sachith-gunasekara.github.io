I am Sachith Gunasekara, a recent graduate with a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science from the University of Kelaniya, where I graduated top of my class with a Cumulative GPA of 3.78/4. My academic pursuits have been centered around large language models (LLMs), with a keen interest in improving their efficiency in fine-tuning and inference, as well as enhancing their reasoning capabilities.

Throughout my journey, I have actively contributed to research initiatives, including projects like "Basis Selection: Low-Rank Decomposition of Pretrained Large Language Models for Target Applications." My findings have been featured in conferences and pre-print platforms, reflecting my commitment to advancing AI research.

Currently, I am seeking a PhD opportunity to delve deeper into these areas, aspiring to develop innovative solutions that push the boundaries of LLM efficiency and reasoning. I look forward to collaborating with pioneering researchers to contribute to the evolving landscape of AI.
